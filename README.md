# prequel-AOR-version

- This is a copy of a group project I worked on for my final project in the Penn LPS coding boot camp.
- You can find the original repo here: https://github.com/jfisher37/prequel
- I also made a fork here, where you will see some of my additions: https://github.com/aidanrich/prequel
- Making my own repo will give me a chance to play around with it a bit more, and track my changes more easily.
